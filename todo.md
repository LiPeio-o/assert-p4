TODO:

- annotations

- what happens if a table doesn't match at all?

-  forward reference extends over definition of value block429967

- bitwise operations
    - “underflow” or “overflow” wrap around
    - Slice
- casts

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBS:

- can bitwise operations be modeled? (they seem to be working on it)
- boolean and/or would be useful
- parse recursion:
    - theoretically limited by the max packet size
